# Changelog

Format specification for CHANGELOG.md based on Keep a Changelog 1.1.0.

## Language Requirement (Mandatory)

- All changelog content MUST be written in English.
- If source information is provided in another language, translate it to English.
- Do not mix languages within the same changelog.

## Quick Reference

### File Header

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
```

### Section Structure

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New feature description

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### Added

- Feature A
- Feature B

### Changed

- Modified behavior X

### Fixed

- Bug fix Y
```

## Types of Changes

| Type         | Purpose                           |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `Added`      | New features                      |
| `Changed`    | Changes in existing functionality |
| `Deprecated` | Soon-to-be removed features       |
| `Removed`    | Now removed features              |
| `Fixed`      | Bug fixes                         |
| `Security`   | Vulnerabilities                   |

## Format Rules

### Version Header

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
```

- Version in brackets, linked to comparison
- Date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Date-Based Versioning (Alternative)

For projects using date-based versioning instead of semver:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

Use current date instead of `[Unreleased]`. This project uses date-based versioning.

### Yanked Releases

```markdown
## [0.0.5] - 2014-12-13 [YANKED]
```

Use when version was pulled due to serious bug or security issue.

### Comparison Links (at file end)

```markdown
[unreleased]: https://github.com/user/repo/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD
[1.0.0]: https://github.com/user/repo/compare/v0.9.0...v1.0.0
[0.9.0]: https://github.com/user/repo/releases/tag/v0.9.0
```

## Guiding Principles

1. **For humans, not machines** — Write clear, readable entries
2. **Entry for every version** — Document all releases
3. **Group same types** — Keep Added/Changed/Fixed together
4. **Linkable versions** — Use comparison links
5. **Latest first** — Reverse chronological order
6. **Show release dates** — Use ISO 8601 format
7. **State versioning scheme** — Mention Semantic Versioning if used

## Bad Practices

### Commit log diffs

**Don't** dump git log into changelog:

- Full of noise (merge commits, obscure titles)
- Not human-readable
- Mixes important and trivial changes

### Ignoring deprecations

**Don't** skip deprecation notices:

- Users need to know what will break
- Document deprecations before removals
- List breaking changes clearly

### Confusing dates

**Don't** use regional date formats:

- Use ISO 8601: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Avoids ambiguity (is 01/02/2024 Jan 2 or Feb 1?)

### Inconsistent changes

**Don't** document only some changes:

- Changelog should be single source of truth
- Important changes must be mentioned
- Consistently updated

## Writing Tips

### Good Entry Examples

```markdown
### Added

- OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers
- Rate limiting for API endpoints (100 req/min)

### Changed

- Database queries now use prepared statements for better security
- Upgraded dependency `lodash` from 4.17.20 to 4.17.21

### Fixed

- Memory leak in WebSocket connection handler
- Race condition in concurrent file uploads
```

### Entry Guidelines

- Review current git changes (diff or changed files list) before drafting; ensure all material changes are covered.
- Start with verb or noun describing the change
- Be specific (mention affected component/endpoint)
- Reference issue/PR numbers when relevant: `(#123)`
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Omit empty sections (do not include a section header if there are no entries for it)

## File Naming

Required: `CHANGELOG.md` (uppercase). Do not use lowercase or alternative names.

Do not use alternative filenames.

## GitHub Releases vs CHANGELOG.md

| Aspect          | GitHub Releases | CHANGELOG.md      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Portability     | GitHub-only     | Universal         |
| Discoverability | Less visible    | Standard location |
| Version control | Separate UI     | In repository     |
| Diff links      | Manual setup    | Easy to add       |

GitHub Releases can complement but shouldn't replace CHANGELOG.md.

## Conventional Commits Integration

Changelogs work best with [Conventional Commits](../commits/SKILL.md) format:

| Commit Type       | Changelog Section    |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `feat:`           | Added                |
| `fix:`            | Fixed                |
| `perf:`           | Changed              |
| `refactor:`       | Changed              |
| `docs:`           | (often omitted)      |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | Highlight in Changed |
| Security fix      | Security             |
| `revert:`         | Removed or Fixed     |

### Automated Generation

Tools that parse Conventional Commits and generate changelogs:

- [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
- [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/)
- [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)

See [commits skill](../commits/SKILL.md) for commit message format.

## Workflow Integration

### Unreleased Section Pattern

1. Add changes to `## [Unreleased]` during development
2. At release time, rename to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Create new empty `## [Unreleased]` section
4. Add comparison link for new version

### Pre-commit Checklist

Before release:

- [ ] All notable changes documented
- [ ] Unreleased section moved to version
- [ ] Date added in ISO 8601 format
- [ ] Comparison link added
- [ ] Breaking changes highlighted
- [ ] Deprecations documented

## Critical Prohibitions

- Do not use git log as changelog
- Do not omit breaking changes or deprecations
- Do not use ambiguous date formats
- Do not leave changelog inconsistently updated
- Do not forget to update Unreleased → version at release
- Do not write changelog entries in any language other than English

## README Synchronization

After writing changelog, review the project's main README.md:

1. **Check for outdated information** — features, skills, tools lists
2. **Add new entries** — if changelog introduces new skills, features, or components
3. **Remove deprecated items** — if changelog removes functionality
4. **Update descriptions** — if changelog changes existing functionality

**What to sync:**

- Skills/features tables
- Compatibility lists
- Installation instructions
- Links and references

**What NOT to sync:**

- Changelog content itself (no duplication)
- Version history
- Detailed change descriptions

**Do NOT mention README.md updates in CHANGELOG** — README synchronization is implied and should not be logged as a separate change.
